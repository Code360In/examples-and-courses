# Handling Imbalanced Data Classification Problems
_Now we will build (project goals). We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:_

+ **Task 1:** To understand the business problem that we are trying to solve and load the required libraries and the dataset into the jupyter notebook session.
+ **Task 2:** To perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset to observe the patterns in the data, how they are related to each other and to visualize the data
+ **Task 3:** To understand how to choose best evaluation metric for this business problem
+ **Task 4:** To create a baseline model and where we will not handle the imbalanced property of the data and which we will use to compare with other advanced models that we will build in upcoming tasks
+ **Task 5:** To create a classification model and where we will handle the imbalanced property of the data by using SMOTE data sampling technique
+ **Task 6:** To learn and implement how to ROC AUC curve and its interpretation
+ **Task 7:** To learn and implement how to adjust probability threshold to increase recall of a model
